            <p class="letras">And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice<br>
                    And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice<br>
                    And they're cursing me<br>
                    And they won't let me be<br>
                    There's nothing to say<br> 
                    And there's nothing to do<br>
                    Stop whispering, start shouting<br>
                    Stop whispering, start shouting<br>
                    And my mother say we don't't love you son some more<br>
                    And the buildings say let me spit on your face some more<br>
                    And the feeling is<br> 
                    That there's something wrong<br>
                    'Cause I can't find the words<br>
                    And I can't find the song<br>
                    Stop whispering, start shouting<br> 
                    Stop whispering, start shouting<br>
                    Dear sir, I have a complaint<br> 
                    Dear sir, I have a complaint<br> 
                    Can't remember what it is<br> 
                    Doesn't matter anyway<br>
                    Doesn't matter anyway<br>
                    Stop whispering, stop whispering<br>
                    Stop whispering, stop whispering, start shouting</p>

            <p class="letras">Been thinking about you, your records are here<br>
                    Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there<br>
                    But I'm still no one, and you're now a star<br>
                    What do you care?<br>
                    Been thinking about you, and there's no rest<br>
                    Should I still love you, still see you in bed<br>
                    But I'm playing with myself?<br>
                    What do you care when the other men are far, far better?<br>
                    All the things you got,<br>
                    All the things you need<br>
                    Who bought you cigarettes,<br>
                    Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey<br>
                    I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?<br>
                    These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet<br>
                    They don't know what I know<br>
                    Why should you care when I'm not there?<br>
                    Been thinking about you, and there's no rest<br>
                    Should I still love you, still see you in bed<br>
                    When I'm playing with myself?<br>
                    What do you care when I'm not there?<br>
                    All the things you got<br>
                    That you'll never need<br>
                    All the things you got<br>
                    I'm played out and bleed to please you<br>
                    Been thinking about you</p>
